Working on mining on Twitter API

# Day 1:
Worked on installing `tweepy` (Twitter API for python) and studying little about it, then worked on creating Twitter developers 
account and accessing consumer key, consumer secret, access key, access secret for authorization into the API. Then read about 
some of it's certain basic modules. Finally worked on code for getting the data from Twitter and printed tweets from timeline 
and got data of friends and saved it into `.json` file.

That was it for Day 1, more work to do next day.
